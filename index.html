High technologies, Robotics, Cryptocurrency, Artificial intelligence move world forward very quickly. According to that, i have a question to myself: what will be my function in this future? So i think the most smarter decision is to be a part of this community. Now this is my main purpose of training in EPAM.</p>
				<p><strong>About my programming skills</strong>: I don’t have any JavaScript practice. Just training in console with algorithms and functions. But I have some experience in using HTML and CSS. There are some websites which I corrected during last 2-3 years in freelance. Now I'm reading "CSS3: The Missing Manual, 3rd Edition (Devid Makfarland, 2016)". And next 2 weeks I'm planning to read "CSS3 for Web Designers (Dan Cederholm, 2012)" and "CSS in Depth (Keith J. Grant, 2019)". After that all my time will be devoted for learning algorithms and JavaScript.</p>
				<p><strong>About my english speaking level</strong>: My english level is B1 by str.by testing, so i can understand english quite well. My vocabulary is not so big and it's my main problem. But i’ll learn it more in future. There are a lot of good websites, where everyone can learn to speak english for free. I will use it also. And I have learned <strong>japanese</strong> for 5 years. I understand it basicly and want to progress in it. I took part in the competition at the Embassy of Japan in Belarus and got some interesting prises such as real cup from Japan. You can find some of my lessons on this <a href="https://pogovorim.by/4138-uroki-yaponskogo-yazyka-dlya-nachinayuschih.html">website</a>.</p>
